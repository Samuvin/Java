Everything in the world can be defined using properties and behaviour

Take a object and write a summary
	from there take noun and adjectives - properties
	from there take verbs               - behaviours
	Which ever you want take it leave others

How to define a object
	To create a object we need a definition
	For example:
		Television object needs its circuit blueprint 
		Car Object needs its designe blueprint
	Television is object - Design is a class
	House is s object -    Design is a class
	Real - Object
	Reel - Class

If we have one class we can make many objects are manufactured 

In Main Memory
  When we create a Object The reference variable for the object is created in the stack while the object is created in the heap
  Objects are always created in main memory
  Inside the main memory there will be a area called as method area ot will contain all the methods
