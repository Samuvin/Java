Oops - Object Oriented Programming

Principles
*Abstraction
*Encapsulation
*Inheritance
*Polymorphism 


Abstraction:
	Hiding the internal details and showing only the required features
	Example:
		Car
			The driver just needs to know how to put brake and gear Not how its stopping the car when the brake is applied
			(avoid showing internal details only show what is required)
			Abstract
Encapsulation
	Everything is in a single capsule That for example television everything is encapsuled in a box that are necessary to run the television Its like a single box

	Car is like a single body everything related to it are present inside that body

	We encapsulate everything inside a box what are related to each other Boxing up
Inheritance
	Television making company is making a televison name Version 1 and they add some more features and release a new model Version 2
	New model of the television is not a completely new one its just the television with the new features along with the old one

	Reusing the Products that are already present in our hand and we are making the similar one and just we are adding some more features to it we just use the alraedy presented one and we use it
	and we add a few extra things

	Iphone 1 - Already Impleted 
	Iphone 3 - Same features are there as of the Iphone 6 but with 
			   some more extra features

	Car 1 - First Version
	Car 2 - Car1 + increase speed + increase engine performace

	Inheritance - Reusing codes which are already present

Polymorphism
	*Specialiation 
	*Generalization 

Specialization
	We already have some Product and if we are adding something to it and Comming up with the new thing  - Inheritance
 
	Iphone 1 - Already Impleted 
	Iphone 3 - Specialization of the Iphone 1

	Benefits:
		We borrow everything and put more feature

Generalization
	Lg samsung Song - can be generalized as television
	Toyato Suzuki - can be generalizaed as Car

	Benefits : 
		Can refer a set of things together we can refer car for toyato suzuki etc
		One thing is enough to refer to allthings
		One message is enough to communicate with all others
	Example :
		we dont learn driving not toyato car driving suzuki car driving
	if we learn how to drive we can drive any car that is generalized
