Class and Object in OOP
	Understanding Objects
	In the real world, anything can be considered an object.
	In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is defined using its properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods or functions).

Properties: Characteristics of an object.
Behaviors: Actions an object can perform or actions that affect the properties.

Example 1: 
Television
     Object: Television
     Properties:
	Material used (e.g., LED, LCD)
	Brand name
	Current channel set
	Current volume
	Brightness level
     Behaviors (methods/functions):
	Increase the volume
	Check the current channel
	Change the channel
	Adjust brightness
Note: The behavior affects the properties. For example, pressing a button to change the volume directly alters the volume property.

Example 2:
Car
	Object: Car
	Properties:
	   Fuel limit
	   Color
           Engine model
	   Speed
	Behaviors:
	   Change speed
	   Apply brakes
	   Change gears
Conclusion: Everything in the world can be defined using properties and behaviors. To identify these:

Nouns and adjectives in a description typically represent properties.
Verbs usually represent behaviors.

Defining an Object
To create an object, a definition (blueprint) is required. This blueprint is called a class.

Example:

A Television object needs its circuit blueprint.
A Car object needs its design blueprint.
In summary:

	Real Object: The actual object (e.g., Television, Car, House).
	Class (Design): The blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of the object.

Example:
Television is an object, and its design is the class.
House is an object, and its architectural design is the class.

Relationship Between Class and Object
If we have a class, we can create many instances (objects) based on that class. For example, the class of a television design can be used to create multiple television objects.

Memory Allocation
When an object is created, it is stored in main memory (heap memory).
The reference variable for the object is stored in the stack.
The object itself is stored in the heap.
there is an area called the method area in memory that contains all the methods related to the class.
